Subject: Request for Club Change from Basketball to IT

Respected Ma'am,

We respectfully express our sincere desire to request a club change from basketball to the IT club.As students of
Class XII Science (Shayyan and Gaurav) and XII Commerce (Mustufa and Rishabh),we strongly believe that aligning ourselves
with the IT club would better suit our interests and academic pursuits.

With utmost humility, we kindly seek your permission to proceed with this club change,as it would significantly enrich our
learning experience and contribute to our personal growth.Given the limited availability of PC machines in the IT lab, the 
club incharge has advised us to bring our personal laptops.Therefore, we also seek your permission in this regard.We 
wholeheartedly appreciate your understanding and support in accommodating our request. Your kind consideration is highly
valued.

Yours faithfully,
(XII Science)
(XII Commerce)

Respected Ma'am,

We, the students of Class XII Science (IP Stream), would like to humbly request your consideration for the installation of air conditioning in the IP lab. As we engage in rigorous practical sessions and coding activities, maintaining a conducive environment becomes crucial for optimal learning and concentration.

The extreme temperatures during certain seasons have proven to be a challenge in our pursuit of academic excellence. The discomfort caused by the lack of adequate cooling hinders our ability to focus and perform at our best. We believe that the installation of air conditioning in the IP lab would greatly enhance our learning experience and create a more comfortable environment for all students.

We understand that this is a significant decision, and we assure you that we will take utmost care and responsibility in the usage and maintenance of the equipment if our request is granted.

We kindly request your favorable consideration of our request and seek your guidance on the necessary steps to initiate this process. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Yours faithfully,

(XII Science, IP Stream)
